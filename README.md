## 📱 Overview

**Indy Space Locator & Citation Portal** is an integrated Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to unify critical parking operations and public-facing utilities within a single, modern interface.

The system streamlines two primary functions:

1. **Space Locator:** A GIS-driven module that identifies and maps metered parking assets by ID or street name.  
2. **Citation Portal:** A secure environment for citation validation and redirection to the City’s official payment infrastructure.

Optimized for on-site reliability, the application offers offline caching, high-contrast visual design, and an interface explicitly tested for outdoor and field use.  

> ⚠️ *Independent project. Not affiliated with or endorsed by the City of Indianapolis.*

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

The system employs a modern, maintainable stack focused on performance and platform independence.

### **Client Application**
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-18-61DAFB?style=flat-square&logo=react&logoColor=black)
![Tailwind](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tailwind-CSS-38B2AC?style=flat-square&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)
![PWA](https://img.shields.io/badge/PWA-Ready-5A0FC8?style=flat-square&logo=pwa&logoColor=white)

- **Framework:** React 18 (served via CDN/Babel for zero-build deployment).  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for consistent, scalable UI design.  
- **Icons:** Lucide React for unified vector iconography.  
- **Offline Mode:** Caching and installation support for uninterrupted use.

### **Middleware (Backend-for-Frontend)**
![Node](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-Middleware-339933?style=flat-square&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)

A Node.js middleware layer provides the application’s BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) abstraction.

- **Data Management:** Interfaces with the Indianapolis Open Data API.  
- **Security:** Isolates API keys and endpoints from the client tier.  
- **Transformation:** Converts raw Esri GIS data into optimized JSON for mobile delivery.

## 🔒 Data and Privacy

- **Parking Asset Data:** Derived in real time from the Indianapolis Open Data Portal.  
- **Citation Information:** No storage, caching, or logging of user queries or identifiers.  
- **Service Availability:** Dependent on source data uptime and reliability.  
- **Privacy Standards:** No tracking or retention of personal data.
